üìã NOTES 

* Display de execution of Exercise 1 in navigator.
* Vehicle.php contains writeInfo() function, which uses magic constants, and an overriding of magic method __toString(), which is overridden in Bike, Car and Bus subclasses. 
* Execution of exercises2and3.php in console generates a txt file with the output of exercises 2 and prints overridden __toString() methods (exercise 3).
* Corrected by Lena Prado.
